# Uber-Analytics-2016-Dataset
This project performs detailed data analysis on a dataset of Uber drives from 2016. It explores the trip details such as start and end locations, dates, categories, miles traveled, and purposes of the trips. The project aims to extract meaningful insights about travel patterns and trip characteristics for Uber rides.

Project Overview
Dataset Used: Uber Drives dataset from 2016 with 1156 entries and 7 key columns including start/end date, category, trip start and stop locations, miles traveled, and trip purpose.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Data cleaning, handling missing values, descriptive statistics, and identifying the distribution of trip types, distances, and purposes.

Visualizations: Various plots including bar charts, count plots, and pie charts to illustrate data distributions such as trip purpose counts, common routes by miles, and trip distance statistics.

Insights: The project reveals patterns in trip purposes, highlights the longest and shortest trips, and analyzes round-trip vs one-way rides.
